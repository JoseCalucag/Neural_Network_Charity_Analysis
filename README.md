<h2> Overview of the Analysis </h2> 
I have been tasked to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants can be successfull if funded by the charity Alphabet Soup. Coupled with a knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I will analyize and use features in a dataset containing more that 34,000 organizations that have previously been funded by Alphabet Soup. With this dataset, I can build a model following these three steps:<br>

1) Preprocessing the data to implement a neural network
2) Compile, train then evaluate the modeled data
3) Optimize the model

<h2> Results </h2>
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

<h3> Data Preprocessing </h3>
* What variable is considered the target for your model?
I considered using the IS_SUCCESSFUL column as my target. <br> 

* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
The features that we are using are every column except for two columms that we dropped in EIN and NAME as they're mostly labeling and don't have beneficial influence to the model. <br>

* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

<h3> Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model </h3> 
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


Summary: 
There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on using a different model to solve the classification problem, and justification (3 pt)
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
